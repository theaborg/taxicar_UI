# RC-car-UI
I created this user interface with Jessica Kjellin. It's part of a larger project with the aim of building a prototype of a taxi car with autonomous steering. It may not look like much, but I've learned a whole lot about servers! :)
To run: clone the repo, then make sure you're standing inside of it. Run the following command in the terminal: "node server.js", now you can open the browser and check the UI out at localhost:5000 !
